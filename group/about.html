        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <div class="kkhistorytext">
          <p>It was the summer of 1942 when Grandpa Rico opened his first taco business at the age of 16 at the border town of Del Rio. Using longstanding recipes passed down from generations, his food quickly gained recognition from the local community. Today, we honor his tradition with only the freshest ingredients and quality of preparation. A lot has changed since his first shop opens; our family has moved to the big apple, we’ve expanded, and we’ve become mobile! Meet up with one of our food trucks to experience our locally sourced, best-in-class tacos today!</p>
