        <p>I'm always taking photos.<br> Living in New York City there's an endless stream of places, people and things to photograph. <br>
        <br>
        Born in the Bronx, I grew up Photographing all things New York.<br> The first photos I ever took were using my grandma's old camera. <br>
        <br>  
        One of my Happiest memories was getting my very own camera on my 14th birthday.
        Since that day, I have been capturing beauty, strength &amp; character in countless photos. I love to photograph regular people going about their daily lives. That always reveal an unexpected aspect of themselves. <br>
        <br>
          I'm based in New York City but travel for projects all around the globe. As well as a passion for photography, I'm also an avid cycling enthusiast and connoisseur of all things paranormal and supernatural. One of my greatest wishes would be to someday photograph a portrait of Big Foot.
